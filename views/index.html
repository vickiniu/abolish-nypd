            What is the people's budget?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We're are calling on the New York City Countil to defund the NYPD by
            <strong>at LEAST a billion dollars</strong> this year.
            <br />
            While City Council's statement that they plan to make these cuts is
            a good first step, we know our work to #DefundNYPD is just getting
            started.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to keep the pressure up to make sure that they follow
            through on this committment and cut at least a billion dollars from
            the NYPD this year. We also need to make sure that these cuts are
            meaningful cuts that actually reduce policing, and that the dollars
            are reinvested in our community's needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're not waiting on "experts" and government officials to suggest
            how we should cut the NYPD and where we should spend that money ‚Äî
            we're asking you to suggest it.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is an open-source budget, we want you to share your ideas on
            what to cut and how to invest!

            This work is open source and collaborative: we value data and
