            What is the people's budget?
          </h2>
          <p>
            We're responding to the call to action to defund the NYPD by
            <strong>at LEAST a billion dollars</strong> this year.
            <br />
            While it's a good first step that the New York City Council released
            a joint statement saying that they plan to make these cuts, we know
            our work to #DefundNYPD is just getting started.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to keep the pressure up to make sure that they follow
            through on this committment and cut at least a billion dollars from
            the NYPD this year.
            <br />
            We also need to make sure that these cuts are meaningful cuts that
            actually reduce policing, and that the dollars are reinvested in our
            community needs."
          </p>
          <h3>
            So we're starting a People's Budget to DEFUND the NYPD, and FUND our
            COMMUNITIES.
          </h3>
          <p>
            We're not waiting on "experts" and government officials to suggest
            how we should cut the NYPD and where we should spend that money ‚Äî
            we're asking you to suggest it.
            <br />
            This is an open-source budget, we want you to share your ideas on
            what to cut and how to invest!

            How do I participate?

          <p>
            There are three different aspects on the People's Budget: Defund the
            NYPD Edition. Plug in to any or all of them! Whatever interests you.
            <br />
            Keep in mind, this is open source, so we want data and
            justifications, but we reject the idea of "expertise." The people
            know best what we need!
