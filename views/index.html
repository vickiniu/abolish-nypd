          WHY DEFUND THE NYPD?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We know our communities are safe and can thrive when we have housing, healthcare, living wages, high quality
          education, and public transit, and the resources and community-based services we need. That’s what New York
          City should be spending its money on — NOT the NYPD.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we say we want to defund the NYPD, we don’t want their funding to disappear into thin air — we demand
          that it is re-invested into our communities.

          HOW DOES DEFUNDING GET US TO ABOLITION? WHY SHOULD WE ABOLISH THE NYPD?

          <p class="quote">
            As an abolitionist organizer working to end policing, incarceration and surveillance, and to create lasting
            alternatives, I know that “defund the police” is not just a slogan- or even the end goal. It is a strategic
            demand that gets us even closer to our mission of abolishing police and prisons. Yes, “defund the police” is
            a
            rallying cry, reminding us that we are deserving of a world without cops. But it is also a concrete step
            towards abolition. It is up to us to fight for that world every chance we get.

        <h2>
          OUR DEMANDS
        </h2>
        <p>
          Ending police violence starts with significant and effective cuts to the NYPD's budget. You may have seen the
          City Council's announcement that they have found $1 billion worth of cuts to the NYPD budget. While this is a
          step in the right direction, we are asking for deeper, more meaningful, and more transparent cuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are our demands:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Release the Council's detailed NYPD cuts proposal.
            </strong>
            We demand that the Speaker release the Council’s proposed cuts immediately to allow for public review and
            complete transparency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Cut NYPD budget and officer headcount by half.
            </strong>
            We demand the police (operating) budget be cut by half ($3B) and the headcount of uniformed officers be cut
            by half to truly address police violence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Cops out of schools and issues that could be addressed by social services and community workers.
            </strong>
            We demand an end to police response to issues that could be transitioned to community workers, and demand
            all officers and NYPD employees be removed from schools, mental health response and co-response teams,
            homeless outreach, neighborhood disputes, transit, and subways.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Redirect funds to Black communities.
            </strong>
            We demand that the City redirect the billions that go to police departments toward providing health care,
            housing, social services, schools, childcare and eldercare, and programs that benefit Black people, that
            would create less need for police in the first place.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Fully transparent NYPD budget.
            </strong>
            We demand a fully transparent NYPD budget that is accessible to the public. It is unacceptable that there
            are large swaths of the NYPD budget unavailable to anyone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              No rollbacks.
            </strong>
            We demand that these cuts remain in place for future fiscal years, and not just as a ‘austerity budget’
            measure. These cuts to the NYPD are in the interest of community safety and the well being of Black people,
            not just savings for the City during this fiscal crisis.
