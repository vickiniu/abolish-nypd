It’s a concrete demand to cut\npolice funding in a way that meaningfully reduces their presence in\nour lives.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just to get rid of that funding, it’s a demand to\nre-invest it in our communities, so that we can be safe and thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>We know our communities are safe and can thrive when we have\nhousing, healthcare, living wages, high quality education and public\ntransit, and the resources and community-based services we need.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s what New York City should be spending its money on, and that’s\nwhat we’re demanding.</p>\n<p>Defunding the NYPD is just one step along the way to radically\nrevisioning community and public safety. It’s the work of abolition.</p>\n<p>Envisioning a world in which instead of cops in schools, our young\npeople have all of the resources and support they need, and their\nteachers do too. Envisioning a world in which instead of ticketing\nhomeless people, every New Yorker has a safe, affordable place to\nsleep. Envisioning a world in which no Black people are ever killed by\nthe cops, a world where no one is ever locked up or separated from\ntheir families, and a world with justice and freedom to thrive.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Abolition + DefundNYPD 101","date":"April 02, 2020","description":"What is #DefundNYPD, and what does abolition mean?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-is-defund-nypd/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/who-does-the-work/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Abolition Organizations + Resources"}},"next":null}}}
