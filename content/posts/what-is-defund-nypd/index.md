What do we mean by defund the police? It’s a concrete demand to cut
police funding in a way that meaningfully reduces their presence in
our lives.

But it's not just to get rid of that funding, it’s a demand to
re-invest it in our communities, so that we can be safe and thrive.

**We know our communities are safe and can thrive when we have
housing, healthcare, living wages, high quality education and public
transit, and the resources and community-based services we need.**

That’s what New York City should be spending its money on, and that’s
what we’re demanding.

Defunding the NYPD is just one step along the way to radically
revisioning community and public safety. It’s the work of abolition.

Envisioning a world in which instead of cops in schools, our young
people have all of the resources and support they need, and their
teachers do too. Envisioning a world in which instead of ticketing
homeless people, every New Yorker has a safe, affordable place to
sleep. Envisioning a world in which no Black people are ever killed by
the cops, a world where no one is ever locked up or separated from
their families, and a world with justice and freedom to thrive.
