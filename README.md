# Abolish the NYPD

This is the source for the [abolishthenypd.com](https://www.abolishthenypd.com) site, which is a
compilation of resources, information, and actions on defunding (and abolishing) the NYPD.

[abolishthenypd.com](https://www.abolishthenypd.com) is the collaborative work of community members and
organizers in New York City. We believe that defunding the NYPD is just the beginning. This project is
meant to be a meaningful and accessible space for folks who are new to the project of abolition to learn
more and become engaged, while still providing resources and highlighting the work of those who have
been in this fight for a long time.

## Technologies

This is site is written in React.js, using Gatsby and the Gatsby blog starter.
We use Airtable with [airtable.js](https://github.com/Airtable/airtable.js)
as a data-store for the contributions to the People's Budget,
which allows for easy access to the underlying data for any editing and moderation.

## Contributing

This work is open-source and meant to be of the community and for the community! If you're reading this

improved — both in terms of the codebase and the infrastructure we have set up!

That said, we absolutely welcome contributions. We abide by the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our Code of Conduct.

You can look to issues to find things we've flagged on as areas for work (improvements, new features,
cleanup) — if you see something else that you'd like to add or work on, feel free to open up a PR!
