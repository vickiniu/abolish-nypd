# Abolish the NYPD

This is the source for the [abolishthenypd.com](https://www.abolishthenypd.com) site, which serves as a landing 
page for resources and actions on the campaign to #DefundNYPD today, and eventually abolish.

This project is written mostly in plain HTML/CSS/JS on the client-side, with an Express server. We use Airtable
with [airtable.js](https://github.com/Airtable/airtable.js) as a data-store for the contributions to the People's Budget,
which allows for easy access to the underlying data for moderation purposes.

Rest TBD
